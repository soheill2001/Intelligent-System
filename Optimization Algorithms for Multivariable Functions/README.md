# Optimization Algorithms for Multivariable Functions

## Introduction
This code explains the implementation of two optimization algorithms, Newton's method and genetic algorithm, for multivariable functions.

## Usage
The code contains two functions, `Newton` and `GeneticAlgorithm`, which implement Newton's Method and Genetic Algorithm respectively. To use these functions, simply call them and pass in the necessary arguments.

The `Newton` function takes the following arguments:

+ `iteration`: the number of iterations to perform
+ `x1`: the initial value of x1
+ `x2`: the initial value of x2

The GeneticAlgorithm function takes the following arguments:

+ `f`: the function to be optimized
+ `n_variables`: the number of variables in the function
+ `minimum`: the minimum value of the variables
+ `maximum`: the maximum value of the variables
+ `pop_size`: the size of the population
+ `max_iteration`: the maximum number of iterations
+ `crossover_rate`: the probability of crossover
+ `mutation_rate`: the probability of mutation

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this code explains the implementation of two optimization algorithms, Newton's method and genetic algorithm, for multivariable functions. These algorithms can be used to find the minimum of complex functions in a relatively short amount of time. However, the choice of the algorithm depends on the nature of the function and the problem at hand.
